"" you could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages , long - range or short - range contracts , peak power or nonpeak , and probably either average could be defended mathematically , "" said nettie hoge of the utility reform network .

,organizational announcement - introducing enron engineering and,"operational services in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit , enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company ( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production corporation ( nepco ) . brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under john gillis , president . with the majority of ee & cc and oec , s activities focused on assets and projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports . this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units which they support . with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design , construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron , s assets on a global basis . this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world . please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments . mark frevert & dave delainey",0

Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument. More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift less than five million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra. The Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States. The California Gold Rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855. Due to its inaccessibility, the range was not fully explore",1

,possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana,"i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows : most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers . as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants . one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from . there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 . if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule . the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent . this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space . robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added . in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center . russell s . long enron net works , llc russell . long @ enron . com ( 713 ) 345 - 3754",0

,fw : portland general electric : order rejecting tariff amendments,"ferc rejected the request by pge to modify the code of conduct so that they could buy on enrononline . basically , ferc did not believe that buying thru enrononline was a guarantee that consumers in oregon would not be harmed . ferc found that there is , for example , no assurance that the posted prices on enrononline represent prevailing market prices . applicants contend that , since pge can transact with epmi via enrononline only at the posted price , there can be no affiliate abuse . we are not certain , however , that the posted price necessarily represents the market price . while , on the surface , enron online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction , the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers ; in fact , for sales the posted prices represent what epmi is willing to sell at , and for purchases the posted prices represent what epmi is willing to buy at . ferc left open the idea that pge could re - file to fix the affiliate abuse . as soon as we hear anything else , i ' ll let you know . jim - - - - - original message - - - - - from : shapiro , richard sent : friday , july 20 , 2001 4 : 14 pm to : steffes , james d . subject : fw : portland general electric : order rejecting tariff amendments - - - - - original message - - - - - from : novosel , sarah sent : friday , july 20 , 2001 10 : 42 am to : robertson , linda ; shapiro , richard ; steffes , james d . subject : portland general electric : order rejecting tariff amendments - - - - - forwarded by sarah novosel / corp / enron on 07 / 20 / 2001 11 : 39 am - - - - - "" emily harris "" 07 / 20 / 2001 11 : 14 am to : , , , , , , , cc : "" andrea settanni "" subject : portland general electric : order rejecting tariff amendments 96 ferc 61 , 093 united states of america federal energy regulatory commission before commissioners : curt h * bert , jr . , chairman ; william l . massey , linda breathitt , pat wood , iii and nora mead brownell . portland general electric company docket no . erol - 2097 - 000 enron power marketing , inc . docket no . erol - 2103 - 000 order rejecting tariff amendments without prejudice ( issued july 20 , 2001 ) in this order we reject , without prejudice , proposed amendments of enron power marketing , inc . ( epmi ) and portland general electric ( pge ) to their respective market - based rate tariffs that would allow them to make inter - affiliate sales using the enrononline trading platform . i . background on may 22 , 2001 , in separate filings , affiliates pge in docket no . erol - 2097 - 000 and epmi in docket no . erol - 2103 - 000 ( collectively applicants ) filed to amend their respective market - based rate schedules to allow for inter - affiliate sales through the enrononline trading platform , and to prohibit communication among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on enrononline or the times that pge will be making trades on 1 enrononline . this amendment does not supplant the existing provisions of pge ' s and epmi ' s currently effective tariffs which allow for inter - affiliate sales subject to conditions that the commission generally imposes on inter - affiliate sales where there are captive customers , e . g . , allowing a public utility to sell to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non - affiliates , requiring simultaneous offers to non - affiliates , or requiring use of a relevant , established index . rather , pge and epmi propose to amend their respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make 1 the enrononline system is administered by enron networks , an enron corp . subsidiary . enrononline is a free , internet - based , transaction system which allows epmi ' s customers to view real time prices from epmi ' s traders and transact instantly online . enrononline is not an epmi application , but rather enrononline is a trading platform used as a tool by epmi in buying from and selling power to third parties . docket nos . erol - 2097 - 000 - 2 - and erol - 2103 - 000 inter - affiliate sales via enrononline , with restrictions different than those in place but that , they state , will still prevent affiliate abuse . applicants state that the commission ' s requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in electronic commerce and , in particular , the commission ' s requirement that "" pge post on its website notice of a potential purchase or sale with epmi prior to pge entering into the transaction with epmi prohibits pge from using enrononline , since enrononline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not provide for a waiting period before consummating the 2 transaction . "" according to applicants , this deprives pge of the ability to buy or sell power "" from perhaps the largest marketer 3 in its region , to the detriment of pge and its ratepayers .

"" in 7 addition , pge will be prohibited from submitting limit orders or engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity of the counter - party is revealed to epmi prior to the transaction being finalized . applicants also propose to amend their respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication regarding prices posted on enrononline . applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate abuse occurs since pge will only be able to transact with epmi at 5 ( . . . continued ) 62 , 539 ( 1997 ) ( gpu ) ; detroit edison company , 80 ferc 61 , 348 at 62 , 197 - 98 ( 1997 ) ( detroit edison ) . in gpu , the commission allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate the public utility paid non - affiliates under certain standard supplier agreements . accord , first energy trading that the utility simultaneously offer through its electronic bulletin board to sell to non - affiliates at the same rate offered to its affiliate ; and that all prices charged to the affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin board . accord , jersey central power commonwealth edison co . , 85 ferc 61 , 288 at 62 , 176 - 77 ( 1998 ) . 6 epmi application at 4 ; pge application at 5 . 7 in the case of a limit order on enrononline , epmi would know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or lower than that currently available . applications at 3 . while applicants do not define "" limit order , "" the common understanding is that , unlike a market order , which instructs a broker to transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in the marketplace , a limit order instructs a broker to fill the order only if certain conditions are met . generally , a limit order may be either a day order , in which case it expires when the market closes if unfilled , or good - until - canceled , in which case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled . docket nos . erol - 2097 - 000 - 4 - and erol - 2103 - 000 the posted price ( a price that is offered to all market participants ) and there will be no transactions in which epmi knows that pge is the counter - party before the transaction is finalized . thus , applicants contend that not only will pge be unable to negotiate special terms with epmi through enrononline , but epmi will have no discretion to take actions which favor pge . applicants further offer that procedures are performed by computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of pge . in addition , because the enrononline price is posted electronically and is available to all market participants , applicants state that pge ' s customers have the opportunity to transact with epmi on enrononline on the same terms and conditions that are available to pge . applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the commission ' s affiliate abuse requirements and conditions ( e . g . , protection against pge buying too high or selling too low in its 8 transactions with its affiliate epmi ) . the thrust of applicants ' argument is that the commission ' s affiliate abuse concerns are satisfied by using enrononline , a public medium , for selling power between affiliates . we disagree . while perhaps faster and easier to use than phone calls , faxes , or letters , an internet - based platform is just another medium for trade , and speed and ease of use do not dictate that the commission ' s affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied . there is , for example , no assurance that the posted prices on enrononline 9 represent prevailing market prices . applicants contend that , since pge can transact with epmi via enrononline only at the posted price , there can be no affiliate abuse . we are not certain , however , that the posted price necessarily represents the market price . while , on the surface , enron online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction , the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers ; in fact , for sales the posted prices represent what epmi is willing to sell at , and for purchases the posted prices represent what epmi 10 is willing to buy at . for other transactions through media other than enrononline , including other exchanges , epmi might be 8 see supra notes 4 - 5 and accompanying text ( citing cases that discuss commission ' s underlying concerns with affiliate power sales ) . 9 see supra note 4 and accompanying text . 10 all transaction on enrononline involve epmi as a participant . for sales , epmi is the seller . for purchases , epmi is the buyer . docket nos . erol - 2097 - 000 - 5 - and erol - 2103 - 000 11 willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices . moreover , applicants provide no information about how product prices posted by epmi are determined , or whether there would be any restrictions on what products pge could trade via enrononline , or even whether there are other similar , but non - affiliated , internet - based venues where pge can electronically trade those products to attain similar benefits . having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be transacting at a prevailing market price via enrononline , we now turn to whether the applicants have met other conditions established by the commission to prevent affiliate abuse . regarding transactions in which epmi may be purchasing from pge through enrononline , there is nothing in the applicants ' proposed restrictions that would require pge to simultaneously offer to sell to non - affiliates at the same rate offered to the affiliate . the commission requires that , with respect to any power offered to its affiliate , pge make the same offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its electronic bulletin board . but it is unclear whether pge can or will make the same offer to non - affiliates . applicants also offer as a protection that pge is prohibited from submitting limit orders , which would prevent epmi from knowing that pge is the counter - party to a transaction . again , this would not prevent epmi from selling power to pge at above - market prices . the commission is not assured by the applicants ' proposal that transactions between pge and epmi conducted via enrononline will occur in a manner that is consistent with the commission ' s expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for inter - affiliate power sales transactions . there is , for example , no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how unaffiliated customers , or other interested parties , would monitor inter - affiliate transactions . for the above reasons , we will reject the proposed amendments , without prejudice to applicants revising their proposal to address the commission ' s concerns and incorporating appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse . 11 likewise , pge might be willing to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices . docket nos . erol - 2097 - 000 - 6 - and erol - 2103 - 000 the commission orders : applicants ' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected , without prejudice , as discussed in the body of this order . by the commission .

,mg : russian prepayment exposure,"interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by tim - says a lot about the way mg do business i think . re ny we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( philip bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a dash for each prepayment on a contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in ny and we may have some issues - although marcelo and others stressed the fact that concentrates appeared to move no product without a letter of credit , which was then often discounted to realise cash ! ! shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment yesterday from philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were ' unique ' - whilst i can accept that each may be tailored to customer preferences - they still need to be cacsed - we should look at the enforceability / legal risk here . whilst information prepayment risk for metals should come from london - accessing any relevent inofrmation from ny may be helpful will call later ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 27 / 07 / 2000 09 : 33 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tim poullain - patterson 26 / 07 / 2000 21 : 53 to : eric gadd / lon / ect @ ect , goran novakovic / lon / ect @ ect , robert quick / lon / ect @ ect , david hardy / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , justin boyd / lon / ect @ ect , howard carter / the metal & commodity co ltd / mgltd @ mgltd cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect , diana higgins / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect , david p tregar / mgltd _ london / mgltd @ mgltd subject : mg : russian prepayment exposure the situation at present is as follows : mg have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper from the russian federation on a prepayment basis all contracts are on a floating price basis ( lme less discount ) notional value of each contract is circa $ 0 . 5 - 3 mm prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis , for between 90 - 95 % value with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents the issues break down into three broad areas : 1 ) commercial at present enron does not engage in prepayment activities with russian federation counterparties . no further prepayments are permitted until rac have performed a dash for this activity . as this is likely to take several weeks howard will liase with commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising from this suspension . howard and david hardy will also take immediate steps to manage down existing prepayment exposures . 2 ) legal based on a cursory review of the confirmations by robert , if we are to continue this activity legal need to instructed to perform a full review for several reasons , including : the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms , e . g . pricing date they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments , and are generally not constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity . "" conditions of purchase "" are attached to the confirmations which refer to english law , but as they are not always countersigned , under conflict rules the closest or real connection may be deemed to be russian law which , in the absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability . there are several "" open "" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are beyond the delivery period , and which could be considered to have been discharged by breach . again the confirmation does not contain adequate language . 3 ) credit / operational there are no formal counterparty limits . nor are prepayment and volumetric exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis . this information is necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance , and needs to be factored into the overall credit monitoring process . david has requested this information from mg , and will follow up this one off exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track exposures based on the methodology developed for helsinki . further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that , despite the issues identified with contractual terms , there is performance against the contracts . david is pursuing this from a credit perspective and will report back to his group his findings by friday latest . the issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to accelerate a planned review of contract language for all mg ' s activities in all jurisdictions . mike and i will discuss bringing this review forward with justin . any questions , please call . regards , tim",0

,direct access 8 / 10 / 01,"below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access . we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated . summary : direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california ' s 1996 deregulation law . under this concept , all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility . the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california ' s costly power crisis . it will determine whether businesses , with residential customers , pay for the bulk of the state ' s future energy purchases . it also could determine whether southern california edison , the state ' s cash - strapped no . 2 utility , will avoid bankruptcy , and whether deregulation will survive in any form . big businesses , free - market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so - called "" direct access "" . now , as the state prepares to sell $ 13 . 4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt , legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct - access escape route . regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system , the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long - term electricity contracts through 2021 . that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $ 43 billion in future power costs , a point that has enraged consumer groups . currently , only about 88 , 000 customers buy their energy through direct access ( per cec statistics ) , including about 10 , 000 large commercial / industrial customers , and about 78 , 000 residences . alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california ' s primary utility suppliers ( socal ed . , pg & e , sdg & e ) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature . california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan , sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley . under the plan , the 3 , 600 largest businesses would agree to pay $ 3 . 1 billion of edison ' s debts over 15 years . in exchange , businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003 , but not without first paying an "" exit fee . "" the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california ' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms . to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd . complicating the issue is wall street . the state ' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy .",0

The question of the financial viability of single-player AAA games was raised following the closure of Visceral Games by Electronic Arts (EA) in October 2017. Visceral had been a studio that established itself on a strong narrative single-player focus with Dead Space, and had been working on a single-player, linear narrative Star Wars game at the time of the closure; EA announced following this that they would be taking the game in a different direction, specifically ""a broader experience that allows for more variety and player agency"". Many commentators felt that EA made the change as they did not have confidence that a studio with an AAA-scale budget could produce a viable single-player game based on the popular Star Wars franchise. Alongside this, as well as relatively poor sales of games in the year prior that were principally AAA single-player games (Resident Evil 7, Prey, Dishonored 2, and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) against financially successful multiplayer games and those offe r a games-as-a-service model (Overwatch, Destiny 2, and Star Wars Battlefront 2), were indicators to many that the single-player model for AAA was waning. Manveer Heir, who had left EA after finishing his gameplay design work for Mass Effect Andromeda, acknowledged that the culture within EA was against the development of single-player games, and with Visceral's closure, ""that the linear single-player triple-A game at EA is dead for the time being"". Bethesda on December 7, 2017, decided to collaborate with Lynda Carter to launch a Public Safety Announcement to save single-player gaming. A few years later in 2021, EA was reported to have revived interest in single-player games, following the successful launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2020. The company still planned on releasing live service games with multiplayer components, but began evaluating its IP catalog for more single-player titles to revive, such as a remake of the Dead Space franchise. Around the same time, head of Xbox Game Studios Phil Spencer said that they still see a place for narrative-driven single-player games even though the financial drivers of the market tended to be live service games. Spencer said that developing such games with AAA-scale budgets can be risky, but with availability of services like cloud gaming and subscription services, they can gauge audience reaction to these games early on and reduce the risk involved",1

,interesting article,"interesting article , especially since it came from britain . . . it does mention enron too . the next global city ? the blob that ate east texas jun 21 st 2001 houston from the economist print edition ( june 23 , 2001 ) for most outsiders , texas is a foreign country . its biggest city , though , might surprise the rest of the world when a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is , reach for the salt . bob lanier , the former mayor of houston , isn ' t actually wearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls 25 miles away in every direction . but metaphorically he is . houston , he claims , could become one of the great cities of the world . the remarkable thing is that he might be right . from the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970 s , houston doubled in size almost every decade . then , despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the 1930 s , the metropolitan area managed to add lm people in the 1990 s to grow to 4 . 7 m , making houston the fourth - largest city in america . it is already bigger than berlin and , with a gdp of around $ 215 billion a year , has a larger economy than hong kong . because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico , it may attract another 2 m people over the next two decades , which would give it almost the same size of population as london has now . but a global city ? these are few and far between . houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like london , new york or tokyo . but its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan , entrepreneurial hub , a hong kong , a san francisco or even a new los angeles . it shares la ' s smog , its sprawl , its latino culture , even its ugly hubris ; and by some measures it surpasses la ' s ability to reinvent its economy . can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place ? oil be there for you its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry . energy accounts for half of houston ' s economy . during the 1970 s , while the rest of america stagflated , houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the country ' s oil capital . in that decade alone , the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in san francisco . money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to $ 50 a barrel . at the height of the boom , about 80 % of the city ' s economy was oil - related . the bust was traumatic . by the mid - 1980 s , all that new office space stood empty . every big local bank was taken over . only one of the property developers then in business is left . unsurprisingly , a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business . the greater houston partnership , the main business lobby , has spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify . yet the fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust . as company after company was forced to cut back , they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again . in 1999 , when oil slumped to $ 10 a barrel and the number of oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory , houston still managed to add energy jobs . now another boom is in prospect , with oil prices high again . matt simmonds , the head of a local energy consultancy , argues that america ' s past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around 30 % in the next ten or 15 years . the rig count is already 50 % above last year , and natural gas exploration is soaring . if oil prices stay high ( a big if ) and if other countries share america ' s energy worries , houston will grow in importance . it is hampered by a wild - catting reputation . in fact , the energy business is changing in three significant ways , and houston is the centre of all of them . first , technology . not long ago , oil drills went down to 1 , 500 feet ( 457 metres ) . now they go to 15 , 000 feet . companies use four - dimensional computer imaging to plan new fields ( time is the fourth ) . this is making oil an information - intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in houston . second , the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone . this makes deal - making vital , which is good for the city where deals are made . if you are not attending , say , lunch at houston ' s petroleum club , you are out of the loop . third and most important , oil is now only part of a bigger energy business , which includes electricity . once divided into self - contained regional markets run by local utilities , the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders . big users now decide whether to buy power at long - or short - term rates , rather as they arrange their financing . a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging , and itscentre is houston . three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago . one of them , enron , is building a 50 , 000 - square - foot trading floor ? ? single - company answer to the chicago board of trade . enron has probably been houston ' s most successful energy company of the past ten years . it has never explored for , pumped up , or refined a single drop ofoil . out of the black stuff however well - placed houston is to take advantage of the energy business , it will never be a great city as a one - trick pony . its boosters point to other strengths : * trade . houston is america ' ssecond largest port , which is remarkable considering it is 50 miles from the sea . * computers . the city is home to compaq , america ' s third - largest pc maker . if you include dell , based in austin , two of america ? ? four big computer firms are in south - east texas , not silicon valley . * space . the national aeronautics and space administration centre is in houston , thanks to lyndonjohnson , a native son . * medicine . houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world . in a moment of extraordinary optimism , the city set aside 700 acres in the middle of town for medicine . the hospitals , clinics and research centres of the texas medical centre employ 55 , 000 people and deal with 70 , 000 patients a day . st luke ' s has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world . md anderson and the texas children ' s hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities , cancerand paediatrics . this list has holes in it . houston has no real financial services ( the mainstay of the biggest global cities ) or pharmaceuticals ( despite the medical centre ) . and some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim . its port ' s success depends on the vagaries of mexico ' s economy . space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the far - off day when the commercialisation of space arrives . the texas medical centre is set up on a not - for - profit basis , so it has not been able to commercialise its activities ( hence the lack of drug firms ) , though a new biotechnology park may help . in fact , houston ' s main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible : its stunning ability to create new firms . for the past three years , houston has created more new companies than any city in america . it is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a first - time job . the reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success . the beauty of entrepreneurialism the first is unmeasurable , a no - holds - barred optimism of the old school . one survey shows that about two - thirds of americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city , eventually you will succeed . but houston ' s figure even at the bottom of the city ' s recession was 75 % , and now it is 88 % , the highest - ever , and ( says the survey ' s author , stephen klineberg of rice university ) the highest of any bigamerican city . it may not be true that anything is possible in houston , but people act as if it were . bill gilmer , the chief economist of the houston branch of the federal reserve system , argues that this explains why houston recovered so fast from the oil bust : unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms , just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business . the second advantage is technical . uniquely for an american metropolis , houston has no citywide zoning ordinances . when planning decisions are made , they are made by developers on their own land . for the would - be entrepreneur , it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in america . lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale . they expand in leapfrog fashion , ignoring small 20 - acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out . this drives land prices sharply down , especially the further you go from the centre . on top of that , an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits . barton smith , a land economist at the university of houston , reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws . lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage ( residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere ) and racially . because there are no zoning laws to force , say , a bankrupt restaurant to re - open as a restaurant , areas change shape quickly . at the same time , houston is less segregated racially than any other city , bymost measures . one should not be over - impressed by this . whites in houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week , but that hasn ' t stopped them heading for the suburbs . much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks , latinos and asians ( the city has america ' s second - largest vietnamese settlement after southern california ) . but because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out ( for example , by requiring that all housing plots be huge ) , houston remains racially desegregated by american standards . this helps draw in immigrant workers , creating a pool of labour . that leads to the third of houston ' s main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the 21 st century : racial tolerance . houston looked like a southern town until the 1970 s : white , with a large black minority . a generation later , its population is roughly one - third white , one - third black and ( slightly over ) one - third brown . other cities have similar profiles but none went from a bi - racial to amulti - racial city quite so abruptly . even more strikingly , it did so peacefully . houston has not had a race riot since 1914 . for the largest southern city to have gone through the civil - rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics . minorities have long been fully or over - represented in the city council , county commissions and the texas state legislature . bob stein of rice university argues that , unlike other growing cities , houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic - minded business leaders , the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city . ken lay , enron ' s chairman , is an example . he has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums , and has a pet project to boost child literacy . rumour has it that he may run for mayor . the effect of this sort of civic - minded activism showed up in the late 1990 s . at a time when america was busily abolishing affirmative - action programmes , houston went the other way : it had a new one approved in a city - wide referendum . for better or worse , this showed how racially tolerant it is . for how much longer ? in many ways , houston is thriving because it has kept alive an old - fashioned , industrial mode of growth , built on cheap land , low taxes , immigrant labour and unfettered pro - business policies . this model may not be enough in the next decades . houston is ugly . it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings . it may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused $ 2 billion - worth of damage . it is also , as al gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign , polluted . since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits , this is a big problem , and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing . business leaders are frantically trying to catch up . in an unusual example of bipartisanship , a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a $ 500 m bond issue to plant lm trees . the greater houston partnership has executed an about - turn on pollution . having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth , it is now on a crash course to cut ozone - creating emissions as fast as it can . if this sudden change of mind is real , it poses a tough question about zoning . houston has 2 , 300 people an acre , compared with 6 , 000 in los angeles and 20 , 000 in new york ( at the other end of the scale ) . this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive . at one point in the early 1990 s , houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except california ( and , of course , texas ) . there are doubts about how much further sprawl can go . three - quarters of the best - paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road . some new suburbs are 50 miles away . can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown ? and surely that means introducing zoning ? lastly , houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high : education . to run his number - one priority , mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige , a former head of the houston independent school district . the president claimed , correctly , that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city ' s education , especially among minorities . what he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough . despite successes in individual schools , half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school , compared with 10 % of whites and 20 % of blacks . whites are abandoning houston ' s public schools . they represent only 12 % of pupils ; 54 % are latino . more than a quarter of today ' s schoolchildren are likely to dropout . in a world where a good job depends on having a college degree , this is alarming . rice university ' s mr klineberg argues that new immigrants from mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900 s . the first wave took several generations to catch up . today ' s immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly . if they do not , they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at houston ' sracial harmony . this is houston can houston make it ? the city has experienced the three big transformations that affect america in their purest form : the change from a raw - material economy to services ; the change from a bi - racial to a multi - racial place ; and the moderation of a no - holds - barred pro - business culture to take account of environmental and social costs . elsewhere , these changes have occurred over 50 years . houston has lived through them in 20 . and the next 20 years will probably be just as dramatic and successful . hold onto those stetsons . copyright ? ? 1995 -

Santos said working on the show helped ""hone her skills in these two fields"" and proved that she ""can also do something aside from acting"". She was later cast in Topel Lee's horror thriller Ouija (2007) alongside Jolina Magdangal, Iza Calzado, and Rhian Ramos. The film was met with mixed reviews; Philip Cu-Unjieng of The Philippine Star wrote, ""There is nothing earth-shaking in the treatment of the material or the performances he elicits from the ensemble."" Jocelyn Dimaculangan, however, noted Santos's ""restrained performance"". Her final appearance that year was in the comedy drama Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo, the sequel to Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo. The response from critics was overwhelmingly negative; the Philippine Daily Inquirer's Nestor Torre Jr. dismissed the film for its ""thrice-told plots and exhausted stellar performances"", while Asilo stated that it ""meanders into a list of issues that eventually clutter up its exposition and focus"". Despite poor critical reception, the film grossed ?122 million (US$2.3 million) at the box office. 20082013: Established actress Santos co-produced and starred in the independent drama Ploning (2008), which was the Philippine submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 81st Academy Awards. Jimenez-David wrote that her performance showed ""maturity and ripeness, a depth of character that hints at a life lived fully and well"", and described the film as ""moving, dazzling, and yet intimate and comforting"". Santos said she considered taking the part as a ""start of a new chapter"" in her career. The film was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival, and Christopher B. Smith Rafael Film Center in the United States. Santos's next role in 2008 was in Jun Lana's psychological horror thriller Mag-ingat Ka Sa... Kulam as a woman who questions her own sanity after a car accident leaves her with amnesia. Critic Karen Caliwara commended Santos's ""versatility"" and considered her to be the film's prime asset. In 2009, Santos worked with Agoncillo and Javier Reyes for the third ti me in the sitcom George and Cecil, which explored a reversal of gender",1

'Sebastian Garcia' via all,[All] Asking you to participate in an questionnaire about Honeypots: Know your Honeypot.,"Dear Honeynet members My name is Sebastian Garcia from the Czech chapter and Czech Technical University in Prague. Together with Carlos Catania (Uncuyo University), Muris Sladic (Czech Technical University in Prague), and Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis (Technical University of Denmark), we would like to ask for your help to conduct a novel and comprehensive study on the current use of honeypots. The main motivation, shared with many of you, is to understand better how honeypots are currently used. Our research questions are: - For which purposes are honeypots used? - Why are honeypots used or not used? - What are the user experiences of honeypots? As you are surely aware, in the last 10 years, there seems to be a sort of resurgence in the use of honeypots, most clearly marked by a growing number of new companies offering honeypot solutions. However, many questions remain unanswered on how this phenomenon may be growing again. We believe that a better understanding of the current use of honeypots, both for research and production purposes, would greatly help all of us move forward to new areas, such as all the new implementations with AI that we are currently seeing. For this reason, we are conducting a small research questionnaire called Know your Honeypot 2024, and we are asking you to please help by participating in a two-part questionnaire. The first part is online, and this text is the invitation. Based on the answers to the first part, we plan a second part with those of you who would like to participate during a short in-person interview during the Honeynet workshop 2024. Drinks are on us. This is an anonymous and privacy-respecting academic research whose results will be shared in this group and published publicly. Your help is greatly appreciated. This is the online questionnaire link (~20mins): https://forms.gle/JwSkZsmNzt75iEcp9 Thanks for your help, and we wish to say hi in Copenhagen if you go.

,discount rates and risk capital,"dear vince : i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of that addresses these issues . very briefly , 1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate . 2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s opportunity cost of capital . 3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify some of the issues that i have raised . please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this . please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you . regards , sheridan - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

,california update 2 / 12,"executive summary : the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60 % . this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below , but also because the 30 - day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week , increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . 1 . utilities vs . cpuc governor davis ' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed . the case will come before the judge on monday , february 12 th . the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities . however , the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ( $ . 01 / kwh ) . this will be left to an appellate court . the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing , by the smaller ipps ( as noted in our reports last week ) or by larger out - of - state generators such as duke , reliant , and dynegy ( as noted in the press this morning ) . this is expected next week or the week after . 2 . prospects for a bailout bill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support . senator burton , despite his public refusals , is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail - out . the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position . they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear . for burton , this is because of his long association with labor unions ; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy . burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him . the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for : bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state , but with some kind of state support ( but less than "" full faith and credit of the state of ca , "" which would not pass ) . this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills ( e . g . $ . 01 , though the actual amount is not known ) . these bonds would be asset - backed securities , with payment receivable from rate payers . the term of these bonds is unknown ; if the term is made quite long ( e . g . 20 years ) , the associated rate increase could be very small . the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets for a very high price . the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , sources believe that this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . as noted in an earlier report , the california legislature habitually does not act until things "" hit the wall . "" it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton ' s lead and support the bail - out plan . the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature . one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail - out in her central valley district is "" 50 to 1 . "" however , an involuntary filing ( or the threat thereof ) may be enough to trigger legislative support . it would allow the argument of an "" imminent threat "" to the people of the state of california . 3 . consumer opposition harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum . if the referendum fails , he intends to attack individual legislators ( though not john burton , who reportedly has "" immunity "" from rosenfield ) . some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail - out plan , then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later . however , if the bail - out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill ( rather than put in place by the puc , for example ) , it cannot be reversed by a referendum . as additional insurance against rosenfield , by supporting the bonds issued under the plan , the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan . while it is not clear that this is a factual argument , it still might impede any referendum .",0

"" the shepherd , always the gentleman , said , "" sure ! "" the blonde thought for a moment and , for no discernible reason , said , "" 352 .

"" the blonde carefully considered the entire flock and finally picked the one that was by far cuter and more playful than any of the others . when she was done , the shepherd turned to her and said , "" o . k . , now i have a proposition for you . if i can guess your true hair color , can i have my dog back ?

Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with territory and courtship and mating, while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact. Other authorities such as Howell and Webb (1995) make the distinction based on function, so that short vocalizations, such as those of pigeons, and even non-vocal sounds, such as the drumming of woodpeckers and the ""winnowing"" of snipes' wings in display flight, are considered songs. Still others require song to have syllabic diversity and temporal regularity akin to the repetitive and transformative patterns that define music. It is generally agreed upon in birding and ornithology which sounds are songs and which are calls, and a good field guide will differentiate between the two. Wing feathers of a male club-winged manakin, with the modifications noted by P. L. Sclater in 1860 and discussed by Charles Darwin in 1871. The bird produces sound with its wings. Bird song is best developed in the order Passeriformes. Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only percussive and rhythmic sounds, such as the storks, which clatter their bills. In some manakins (Pipridae), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for stridulation not unlike those found in some insects. The production of sounds by mechanical means as opposed to the use of the syrinx has been termed variously instrumental music by Charles Darwin, mechanical sounds and more recently sonation. The term sonate has been defined as the act of producing non-vocal sounds that are intentionally modulated communicative signals, produced using non-syringeal structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers. Song is usually delivered from prominent perches, although some species may sing when flying. In extratropical Eurasia and the Americas almost all song is produced by male birds; however, in the tropics and to a greater extent the desert belts of Australia and Africa it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been known for a long time and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cann",1

In November 1958 the then-Federal Aviation Agency, now Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), took over operations of the AMB. The lease transferred to the FAA and was sold for $55,000. Atlantic City decided to retain 84 of the 4,312 acres. The FAA expanded the former U.S. Navy land parcel to about 5,000 acres (20 km2) and established the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center research facility that eventually became the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) initially leased portions of the airport from the FAA and now serves as the airport owner and operator of the facility. When the Navy departed in 1958, the 119th Fighter Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard relocated to Atlantic City from their former base at Newark International Airport with their F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft, establishing an Air National Guard base on the site of the former naval air station. The current 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard has been at this location ever since. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the active duty U.S. Air Force's 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, stationed at Dover AFB, Delaware, maintained an Operating Location and Alert Detachment of F-106 Delta Darts at Atlantic City ANGB on 24-hour alert. After the 177th Fighter Wing reequipped with the F-106 in 1973, the 177th took on the air defence alert mission. In the fall of 1983, American International Airways attempted to operate a small hub at the airport with Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with passenger service to Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Tampa and West Palm Beach. ACY has also had US Airways jet service to Pittsburgh as well as US Airways Express turboprops to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, and Continental Express turboprops and regional jets",1

Firstly, and most importantly, the guard would use the brake van's brakes to assist with keeping the train under control on downwards gradients, and whenever they could see that the locomotive's crew was attempting to slow the train. Route knowledge would allow the guard to initiate the braking before the driver. To aid in this, signalling regulations mandated that signals be left at clear until the entirety of a train (including guard's van) had passed, as the guard would immediately apply brakes upon seeing a signal at danger. Secondly, they minimized the risk of snapped broken couplings by application of handbrake wheel, which would keep otherwise-loose screw couplings taut between unfitted wagons. This helped mitigate the risk of a coupling failure from uneven acceleration (""snatching"" or jerking). This was particularly a problem as locomotives became more powerful. Because coupling failures were a fairly common occurrence when starting an unfitted train, train crews were given specific instruction upon starting a freight train that the footplate crew look back towards the brake van for a signal from the guard (by flag or lamp) that the entire train was moving and all couplings were taut, before accelerating to higher speeds. Preserved SR ""Queen Mary"" bogie brake van - most British brake vans had just four wheels and a rigid wheelbase. This one has all three side lamps visible. A later job of the guard was the provision of side lamps on brake vans. The white lamp is the tail lamp, whilst the grey lamps are the side lamps, along with the standard tail lamp (showing red to the rear and sides) required on the rear of every train. The side lamps showed a white light towards the front and a red light to the side/rear. The front-facing lamps were an indication to the locomotive crew that the train was still complete, whilst the provision of extra red lights to the rear was an additional safety measure. Due to the very low chance of all three lights being out at once, it was stipulated that a freight train passing without any lamps on the rear had split and that the rear portion was potentially running away. These side lamps were used on passenger trains before the adoption of continuous brakes on such trains. A further purpose for these side lamps was altering the colour of illumination lamps. Because the red indication was provided by a removable filter, a white light c",1

The bones showed that the bird was a heron, first named Ardea megacephala in 1873, but moved to the night heron genus Nycticorax in 1879 after more remains were described. The specific name megacephala is Greek for ""great-headed"". Two related extinct species from the other Mascarene islands have also been identified from accounts and remains: the Mauritius night heron and the Runion night heron. The Rodrigues night heron was robust, its bill was comparatively large, stout and straight, and its legs were short and strong. It is estimated to have been 60 cm (24 in) long, and its appearance in life is uncertain. There was marked sexual dimorphism, males being larger. Little is known about its behaviour, but the contemporary accounts indicate that it ate lizards (probably the Rodrigues day gecko), was adapted to running, and although able to fly, rarely did so. Examinations of the known remains have confirmed its terrestrial adaptations; one researcher thought the species flightless but this idea hThe French traveler Francois Leguat mentioned ""bitterns"" in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies about his stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues from 169193.

Leguat's observations on the local fauna are considered some of the first cohesive accoun ts of animal behaviour in the wild. In 1873, the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards described subfossil bird bones from Rodrigues he had received via the British ornithologist Alfred Newton. These had been excavated in 1865 under the supervision of his brother, Colonial Secretary Edward Newton, by the police magistrate George Jenner, who found the specimens in a cave on the Plaine Corail, near Rodrigues solitaire remains.

The territory of present-day Hungary was historically a crossroad for various peoples, including Celts, Romans, Huns, Germanic tribes, Avars, South Slavs, West Slavs. The foundation of the Hungarian state was established in the late 9th century by the conquest of the Carpathian Basin by lmos and his son rpd. King Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a Christian kingdom. The medieval Kingdom of Hungary was a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. Following the Battle of Mohcs in 1526, the Kingdom of Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire until the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary in 1867, a major power into the early 20th century. Austria-Hungary collapsed after World War I, and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. Following the tumultuous interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Postwar Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, leading to the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic. Following the failed 1956 revolution, Hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressed, member of the Eastern Bloc. The removal of Hungary's border fence with",1

,california update 3 / 22 / 01,"executive summary : ? the as yet unnumbered rescue bill by davis made it to the senate floor ? an exemption of the gas - fired qfs from this bill ( as proposed by sen . keeley ) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing . ? if passed , the draft cpuc order would give the utilities another 15 days after rate hikes to pay the qfs ? the negotiations with the qfs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the dwr . senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the dwr . ? the calenergy ruling ( as reported by bloomberg this pm ) is an attractive option for other qfs looking to at least temporarily escape long - term supply contracts with edison . ? if neither the cpuc nor the legislature exempts the gas - fired generators from the new rate structure , an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected . however , if the exemption is implemented , then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed . 1 . "" qf bill "" makes it to senate floor the "" cpuc bill "" ( the number is not yet known ) is in mock - up form and does the following : * repeals puc code section 390 , which set a formula for qfs under deregulation . * amends portions of ab lx which will ensure that dwr receives money for its power purchases , and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds . * includes a provision for sdg & e rates since they were not covered under other legislation . the bill passed the senate energy ( 8 - 2 ) , and also just passed the senate appropriations committee ( 8 - 2 ) and is headed to the senate floor . 2 . senator comments on the bill : keeley ( author of bill ) presented that the bill would allow the puc to decide the qf contracts which is the proper authority to debate the issue . most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the puc regarding voided costs for natural gas - fired qfs . republicans offered an amendment to not have section 390 repealed for gas - fired generators , but keeley had concerns with the amendment . keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the puc ' s flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad . he also indicated that gas - fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order . he said that the puc order needs to be amended , and keeley is confident that the puc has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 hours . 3 . opponents to the qf bill : the following people testified in opposition to qf portion : turn , delta power ( qf ) , syke energy , john hancock financial , california manufacturers association , crockett cogeneration , independent energy producers , clean power campaign , pg & e , sce . the gas - fired qfs that testified in opposition noted that they have been off - line for a couple of months and cannot come back on - line unless their issues are addressed . in response to the qfs not getting paid , sen . bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the qfs as directed under the draft order , then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy . 4 . pg & e and sce testimony : sen . battin asked both utilities about the draft order , which states that after the change in the rates by qfs the utilities must pay the qfs within 15 days , and whether the utilities would abide by the order . pg the draft order would lower the qf cost to $ 140 million . pg & e was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to battin ' s question was "" yes or no . "" battin , bowen and murray all asked whether it was yes or no . the pg & e rep stated that it would be "" no "" if the issue of the payments owed to iso and dwr is not resolved . if the iso costs of purchases were included in the dwr payments , then pg & e would not have a problem . the sce response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out , then it could not comply with the puc order . 5 . payments to dwr senator sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under ab lx that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the dwr for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those . sce responded that they are still in negotiations with dwr on the terms and conditions . several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill , and that they should have a trust fund set up . pg & e noted that they are setting ' some ' money aside , but would not state how much . sen . sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or ' go after them ' for violating the law . lx provisions : tim gage from dept . of finance noted the governor ' s support of the entire bill , and noted that the lx provisions would ensure that dwr gets paid . pg & e also testified in opposition to these provisions . senator bowen made the following statements : * senator peace has announced that he has received another notice of $ 500 million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless pg & e and sce drop their challenge to the puc regarding the dwr issue . * also stated that the puc could always raise rates as a way to resolve the issue .",0

,re : thoughts post turbine meeting,"louise , i would not take a $ 10 mm hit on the mitsubishis right now - we have just started to market these and there seems to be some interest ( even if it appears to be flaky ) . if we forced a qiii sale ( drop dead date - you are fired if it doesn ' t happen ) , i think we might lose as much as $ 10 mm - $ 20 mm . although i am not comfortable with our overall turbine position , i am comfortable with our current approach . abb liquidity is more of a concern even though it is a significantly smaller exposure . regards , chris calger 503 - 464 - 3735 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : monday , august 06 , 2001 11 : 41 am to : calger , christopher f . ; wiggs , brett ; jacoby , ben subject : thoughts post turbine meeting is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee . i know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $ 10 mm to cancel the contracts ? if we could do we want to do this ? how much money would we lose ( how much of a write down would we take ) if i told you i wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of september ? as an aside , the mitsubishis will be leaving the enron americas balance sheet now and moving to egas . this does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward . for the company overall , we need to move these turbines ( as with all the others ) as soon as possible and we ( in the americas ) are in a much better position than egas is to move them . i have spoken to jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward . louise",0
